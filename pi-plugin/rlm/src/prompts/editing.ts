 * Editing root prompt for `propose_edits`.

 * The RLM paper (Algorithm 1) requires the root model to invoke the sub-LLM

 * engine run via `llm_query`, not as separate TypeScript-orchestrated runs.
 *
 * This single prompt instructs the model to drive a generate→validate→revise
 * loop using `llm_query`, then return the final diff through the `answer`
 * object (which the engine surfaces as `RlmResult.answer`).
